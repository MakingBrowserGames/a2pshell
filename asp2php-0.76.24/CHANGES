- I was using system() calls to mkdir -p to make directories for a couple
of reasons 1) cause it would automatically create all dirs that didn't exist
and 2) cause it set up file permissions the way the system would want it.
this fails miserably on DOS (aka, Microsoft Windows) so I switched it now
to mkdir().  I'd still rather use mkdir -p, but owell.  Anyway, this should
fix problems with people using DOS (aka Microsoft Windows).
